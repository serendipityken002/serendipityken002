### 🔥 **Technical Manifesto**
> *"I am ready to take responsibility for all my past mistakes, yet I do not regret any of my decisions nor ever doubt my judgment.</br>
> When things did not go as wished, it was simply because my capabilities fell short; nothing more, nothing less.</br>
> I will not judge my past self from the perspective of today, for that would be unfair. Even if given a chance to relive those moments, with the same experiences and mindset of that time, I would inevitably make the same choices."*</br>
